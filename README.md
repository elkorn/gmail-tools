gmail-tools
===========

A set of shorthands for using GMail without a mouse.
The idea is for them to work like a GUI test does, avoiding as much GMail JS as possible.

They are meant to be used against the basic HTML interface (because it's faster).
I'm using these on top of Vimium, through TamperMonkey.

Public commits are yet to come, the project needs to take better shape as of now.
